# freeCodeCamp JavaScript and Algorithms and Data Structures Coursework

This repo contains my code for freeCodeCamp's open source course for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. This course introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript including: 
- Variables
- Arrays
- Objets
- Loops 
- Functions

However, this course also covers basic and intermediate algorithm scripting. The majority of the code uploaded to this repo will be for those sections and the JavaSCript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects Section. I felt that the basic sections would take up too much space on this repo that I would rather use for more complex problems and solutions.
